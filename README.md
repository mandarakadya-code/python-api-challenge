The code conatins solution to the following requirements:

WeatherPy:
Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
	Latitude vs. Temperature
	Latitude vs. Humidity
	Latitude vs. Cloudiness
	Latitude vs. Wind Speed
	
Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
	Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
	Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
	Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
	Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
	Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
	
VacationPy:
Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.
For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map
